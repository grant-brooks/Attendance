# Robotics Attendance
Helps to keep track of robotics club attendance.

##Proximity Detection

With Proximity Detection, **Robotics Attendance** detects whether or not you are within an ample distance of the school to mark yourself present at robotics and acts accordingly. If you are outside of the ample distance, you will not be able to mark yourself present.

##Elegant Design

The interface design of **Robotics Attendance** is simple in its aesthetic familiarity, yet takes liberties as an iPad application to flirt with desktop-level design schemes. 

##Statistical Functionality

**Robotics Attendance** tracks various data about your reported attendance at robotics, allowing you to judge for yourself how complete your dossier is.
